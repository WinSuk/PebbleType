PebbleType is currently just a typing demo, with plans for actual SMS functionality.

Controls:
- Wrist rotate: Choose letter/letter group
- Select: Insert letter/select group
- Select long-press: Send message (currently a placeholder)
- Up: Shift > Caps lock > neither
- Down: Backspace; return to group list

Future plans:
- Send SMS with threads & message history
- Button labels & indicator for caps lock
- Send confirmation
- Customizable hotwords and emoticons

I am very new to C (and Pebble), so pull requests & issues are definitely welcome :)
